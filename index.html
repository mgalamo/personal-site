            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hey! My name is Melodie Galamo, I'm Cameroonian-American and an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science 
                with a minor in French. I hope to eventually pursue a career in Data Science as a Data Analyst or Research. I also 
                strive to work in the entertainment industry with one or several clients. When I am not studying or researching, I 
                perform at symphonic concerts as I play the violin. On my free time, I enjoy going to afrobeat dance camps, performing,
                or traveling to places that are least likely to be gone to as voyage. I like to consider myself as a jack of all trades as I 
                have profound talent in cooking, braiding, drawing, and kick-boxing!
